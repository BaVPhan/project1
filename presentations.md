# Presentations

Presentations will start on Wednesday at 2:00pm. We expect everyone to attend every session
and will provide 15 minute breaks between each session.

This means **no working on your code** while others are presenting. This is your chance
to ask others how they tackled their project.

Each session of presentations will be science-fair style. Several people will set up at
a given time, and other students will walk around asking questions like:

- What would you do differently?
- What are you most proud of?
- What would you do next?
- How did you plan your project?
- What did you learn?

## Schedule for Presentations
Groups were assigned randomly, to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to see presentations of a range of different game types, by members of every squad.
