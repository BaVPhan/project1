# How to Ask Questions
In order to receive help on an issue you are having during your development
process you must submit a Github Issue for your project. Below is a guide for
the information that must be included when submitting an issue. It is expected
that you will try to debug/solve an issue prior to submitting a request for help
on Github.

### Context
When submitting an issue provide some context as to what the problem is. This
includes but is not limited to:
- What User Story you are currently working on
- What you are trying to do (in terms of code)
- Detailed description of the bug or error
- Relevant code/files/errors (and screenshots if applicable)
- Gems and/or other technologies being used (if applicable)

### What have you tried?
Give information about what you have done to solve the problem. Including but
not limited to:
- Documentation you have looked at
- Steps you have taken to solve the problem
- Resources you have used

### Question

What would you like help with specifically?

Try explaining what you did, what you were expecting, and what happened.
